   <body>
    An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is 
  <br>   a unique string of numbers assigned to each device 
  <br>   connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol
      for communication. 
  <br>    It serves as an identifier that allows devices to send and receive
  <br>     data over the network, ensuring that this data reaches 
       the correct destination.
