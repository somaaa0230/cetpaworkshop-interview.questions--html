     #What is dns and when it come in picture?
     <br>
     The function of DNS server is resolving (translating) human-readable domain names(facebook.com) to corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses .
     <br>
     Ex: www.prepbytes.com 93.184.216.34.
     <br>
     The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.
     <br>
     DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP Addresses for domains.
     <br>
     (like google.com, prepbytes.com etc..)
     <br>
     So as in pictures also it comes in with the picture address codes or 
     the correct domain of any particular picture.
