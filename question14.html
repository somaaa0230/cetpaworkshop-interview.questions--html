  <br>  Localhost is a form of hostname, meaning the specific computer
    <br> that the program is running on.
  <br>    It is employed as a method of connecting to services
      <br> on the network on the physical host machine without the services
    <br>    of an outer network. When using ''localhost'',
      <br>   you are connected to your computer or the node that is addressed by
    <br>      the IP address 127. Often used for testing and development,
    <br>       it lets developers run and test Web applications,
      <br>      or any other network service, 
    <br>        locally before putting them on a live server.
    <br>    To summarize, it can be mentioned that localhost is the loopback network interface.
