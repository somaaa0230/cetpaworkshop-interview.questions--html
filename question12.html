   <body>
    DNS is a hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates
     domain names into IP addresses. <br>
     When you type a domain name into your browser, DNS ensures that the
      request reaches the correct server by resolving the domain to
       its corresponding IP address. <br>

Without DNS, wed have to remember the numerical IP address of every
 website we want to visit, which is highly impractical
